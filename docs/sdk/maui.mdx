import Alert from "../../src/components/Alert";

This is the documentation for the MAUI package. Before integrating, read the [native SDK documentation](/sdk) to familiarize yourself with the platform.

## Install

Install the package from [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/RadarIO.Xamarin/):

```bash
Install-Package RadarIO.Xamarin
```

<Alert alertType="info">
  RadarIO.Xamarin supports both Xamarin and MAUI bindings.
</Alert>

If you have an iOS and an Android project, add the package to each project.

## Integrate

### Initialize

First, initialize the SDK:

```cs
using RadarIO;
using static RadarIO.RadarSingleton;

namespace MyProject
{
    public class Example
    {
        void Example ()
        {
            RadarSingleton.Initialize(new RadarSDKImpl());
            Radar.Initialize(publishableKey);
        }
    }
}
```

### Identify user

To identify the user when logged in, call:

```cs
Radar.UserId = userId;
```

where `userId` is a stable unique ID for the user.

To set an optional dictionary of custom metadata for the user, call:

```cs
Radar.Metadata = metadata;
```

where `metadata` is a `JSONObject` with up to 16 keys and values of type string, boolean, or number.

Finally, to set an optional description for the user, displayed in the dashboard, call:

```cs
Radar.Description = description;
```

where `description` is a string.

You only need to call these functions once, as these settings will be persisted across app sessions.

Learn about platform-specific implementations of these functions in the [iOS SDK documentation](/sdk/ios) and [Android SDK documentation](/sdk/android).

### Request permissions

Before tracking the user's location, the user must have granted location permissions for the app.

See the [MAUI Permissions docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/maui/platform-integration/appmodel/permissions) to learn how to check and request permissions.

### Foreground tracking

Once you have initialized the SDK and the user has granted permissions, you can track the user's location.

To track the user's location in the foreground, call:

```cs
var (status, location, events, user) = await Radar.TrackOnce();
```

Learn about platform-specific implementations of this function in the [iOS SDK documentation](/sdk/ios) and [Android SDK documentation](/sdk/android).

### Background tracking

On iOS and Android, once you have initialized the SDK and the user has granted permissions, you can start tracking the user's location in the background.

For background tracking, the SDK supports custom tracking options as well as three presets:

- **`TrackingOptionsEfficient`**: A low frequency of location updates and lowest battery usage. On Android, avoids Android vitals bad behavior thresholds.
- **`TrackingOptionsResponsive`**: A medium frequency of location updates and low battery usage. Suitable for most consumer use cases.
- **`TrackingOptionsContinuous`**: A high frequency of location updates and higher battery usage. Suitable for on-demand use cases (e.g., delivery tracking) and some consumer use cases (e.g., order ahead, "mall mode").

Learn about platform-specific implementations of these presets in the [iOS SDK documentation](/sdk/ios) and [Android SDK documentation](/sdk/android).

To start tracking the user's location in the background, call one of:

```cs
Radar.StartTracking(Radar.TrackingOptionsEfficient);

Radar.StartTracking(Radar.TrackingOptionsResponsive);

Radar.StartTracking(Radar.TrackingOptionsContinuous);
```

You only need to call these methods once, as these settings will be persisted across app sessions.

Though we recommend using presets for most use cases, you can customize the tracking options. See the [tracking options reference](/sdk/remote-configuration).

```cs
RadarTrackingOptions trackingOptions = Radar.TrackingOptionsContinuous;
trackingOptions.DesiredStoppedUpdateInterval = 180;
trackingOptions.DesiredStoppedUpdateInterval = 60;
trackingOptions.DesiredSyncInterval = 50;
trackingOptions.DesiredAccuracy = RadarTrackingOptionsDesiredAccuracy.High;
trackingOptions.StopDuration = 140;
trackingOptions.StopDistance = 70;
trackingOptions.Sync = RadarTrackingOptionsSync.All;
trackingOptions.Replay = RadarTrackingOptionsReplay.None;

Radar.StartTracking(trackingOptions);
```

To determine whether tracking has been started, call:

```cs
Radar.IsTracking;
```

To stop tracking the user's location in the background (e.g., when the user logs out), call:

```cs
Radar.StopTracking();
```

Learn about platform-specific implementations of these functions in the [iOS SDK documentation](/sdk/ios) and [Android SDK documentation](/sdk/android).

To listen for events, location updates, and errors, you can add event listeners:

```cs
Radar.ClientLocationUpdated += (result) =>
{
    // do something with result.location, result.stopped, result.source
};

Radar.LocationUpdated += (result) =>
{
    // do something with result.location, result.user
};

Radar.EventsReceived += (result) =>
{
    // do something with result.events, result.user
};

Radar.Error += (err) => {
    // do something with err
};
```

<Alert alertType="warning">
  Listeners should be set only once and before tracking begins.
</Alert>

### Mock tracking

On iOS and Android, you can simulate a sequence of location updates for testing. For example, to simulate a sequence of 10 location updates every 3 seconds by car from an `origin` to a `destination`, we can call:

```cs
RadarLocation origin = new() { Latitude = 40.714708, Longitude = -74.035807 };
RadarLocation destination = new() { Latitude = 40.717410, Longitude = -74.053334 };

Radar.MockTracking(origin, destination, RadarRouteMode.Car, 10, 3, data =>
{
    System.Console.WriteLine($"{data.Location.Latitude} {data.Location.Longitude}");
});
```

### Trip tracking

On iOS and Android, to start a trip to a destination, call:

```cs
RadarTripOptions tripOptions = new()
{
    ExternalId = "299",
    DestinationGeofenceTag = "store",
    DestinationGeofenceExternalId = "123",
    Mode = RadarRouteMode.Car
};

await Radar.StartTrip(tripOptions);
Radar.StartTracking(Radar.TrackingOptionsContinuous);
```

Later, to complete the trip and stop tracking, call:

```cs
await Radar.CompleteTrip();
Radar.StopTracking();
```

Or, to cancel the trip and stop tracking, call:

```cs
await Radar.CancelTrip();
Radar.StopTracking();
```

Learn more about [trip tracking](/trip-tracking).

### Manual tracking

You can manually update the user's location by calling:

```cs
RadarLocation loc = new() { Latitude = 40.714708, Longitude = -74.035807, Accuracy = 65 };

var (status, location, events, user) = await Radar.TrackOnce(loc);
```

Learn about platform-specific implementation of this function in the [iOS SDK documentation](/sdk/ios) and [Android SDK documentation](/sdk/android).

### Other APIs

The MAUI SDK also exposes APIs for anonymous context, geocoding, search, and distance.

#### Get location

Get a single location update without sending it to the server:

```cs
var (status, location, stopped) = await Radar.GetLocation();
```

#### Context

With the [context API](/api#context), get context for a location without sending device or user identifiers to the server:

```cs
var (status, location, context) = await Radar.GetContext();
```

#### Geocoding

With the [forward geocoding API](/api#forward-geocode), geocode an address, converting address to coordinates:

```cs
var (status, addresses) = await Radar.Geocode("20 jay st brooklyn ny");
```

With the [reverse geocoding API](/api#reverse-geocode), reverse geocode a location, converting coordinates to address:

```cs
RadarLocation loc = new() { Latitude = 40.714708, Longitude = -74.035807 };

var (status, addresses) = await Radar.ReverseGeocode(loc);
```

With the [IP geocoding API](/api#ip-geocode), geocode the device's current IP address, converting IP address to city, state, and country:

```cs
var (status, address, proxy) = await Radar.IpGeocode();
```

#### Search

With the [autocomplete API](/api#autocomplete), autocomplete partial addresses and place names, sorted by relevance:

```cs
RadarLocation near = new() { Latitude = 40.714708, Longitude = -74.035807 };

var (status, addresses) = await Radar.Autocomplete("brooklyn roasting", near, 10);
```

With the [geofence search API](/api#search-geofences), search for geofences near a location, sorted by distance:

```cs
RadarLocation near = new() { Latitude = 40.714708, Longitude = -74.035807 };

var (status, location, geofences) = await Radar.SearchGeofences(near, 1000, new string[] { "venue" }, limit: 10);
```

With the [places search API](/api#search-places), search for places near a location, sorted by distance:

```cs
RadarLocation near = new() { Latitude = 40.714708, Longitude = -74.035807 };

var (status, location, places) = await Radar.SearchPlaces(near, 1000, new string[] { "starbucks" }, null, null, 10);
```

#### Distance

With the [distance API](/api#distance), calculate the travel distance and duration from an origin to a destination:

```cs
RadarLocation origin = new() { Latitude = 40.78382, Longitude = -73.97536 };
RadarLocation destination = new() { Latitude = 40.70390, Longitude = -73.98670 };

var (status, routes) = await Radar.GetDistance(origin, destination, new[] { RadarRouteMode.Foot, RadarRouteMode.Car }, RadarRouteUnits.Imperial);
```

#### Matrix

With the [matrix API](/api#matrix), calculate the travel distances and durations between multiple origins and destinations for up to 25 routes:

```cs
var (status, routes) = await Radar.GetDistance(origins, destinations, new[] { RadarRouteMode.Car }, RadarRouteUnits.Imperial);
```

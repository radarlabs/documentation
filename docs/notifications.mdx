Use Radar's on-premise notifications to display a notification on iOS devices when a user enters a geofence. Notifications work even with only foreground or <b>"when in use"</b> permissions!

## Quickstart

First, [sign up](https://radar.com/signup) for Radar and get an API key.

Then, [create geofences](/geofences#create-geofences) via the dashboard, CSV import, or the API.

From there, add values for the following `metadata` keys to the geofences that will trigger notifications.

###### Metadata keys
- **`radar:notificationText`** (string, required): The body text of the notification.
- **`radar:notificationTitle`** (string, optional): The title of the notification, displayed in bold.
- **`radar:notificationSubtitle`** (string, optional): The subtitle of the notification, displayed in bold.
- **`radar:notificationRepeats`** (boolean, optional): Determines whether the notification should be delivered multiple times before notifications are registered again. Defaults to `false`.
- **`radar:notificationURL`** (string, optional): The URL to open when the notification is tapped.

Finally, [integrate the SDK](/sdk/ios) and call `Radar.trackOnce()` or `Radar.startTracking()`, depending on your use case. Make sure that the `syncGeofences` [tracking option](/sdk/tracking#ios) is enabled. Radar will display a notification when the device is detected inside a geofence that has the above `metadata` keys.

## How it works

Radar's on-premise notifications make use of location notification triggers on iOS. These triggers work with foreground or <b>"when in use"</b> permissions. This feature is privacy-friendly and won't collect any additional location data. Notifications are only displayed after the user opens the app for the first time with the [Radar SDK](/documentation/sdk) installed.

No additional lines of code are necessary to power on-premise notifications. They function completely under the hood after setup. The same calls to `Radar.trackOnce()` and `Radar.startTracking()` will return nearby geofences with notifications, which will then be registered on the device.

Radar only controls the registration of notifications on the device. Once that happens, surfacing notifications is subject to the [system limits and heuristics](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotifications/unlocationnotificationtrigger#overview) that iOS enforces.

  You need to be outside a geofence when it is registered on the device for the notification to fire upon entry.

## Analytics

With Radar [Conversions](/api#log-a-conversion), you can log an event whenever a user interacts with a notification.

Add the [following line](https://github.com/radarlabs/radar-sdk-ios/blob/master/RadarSDK/Include/Radar.h#L558-L564) to your `UNUserNotificationCenterDelegate` implementation to instrument `opened_notification` events.

```swift
extension AppDelegate: UNUserNotificationCenterDelegate {
  func userNotificationCenter(_ center: UNUserNotificationCenter,
                              didReceive response: UNNotificationResponse,
                              withCompletionHandler completionHandler: @escaping () -> Void) {

    Radar.logConversion(request: response.notification.request)
  }
}
```

## Deep linking

Radar's on-premise notifications can be used for deep linking. This means that you can use Radar's deep linking functionality to open a specific view via on premise notification taps.

Set up deep linking from the Radar's Dashboards by adding the **`radar:notificationURL`** to the `URL Schemes` of the desired navigation view of your app.

### Automated iOS setup

Radar's iOS SDK can automatically set up deep linking for you. To enable this feature, set the `autoHandleNotificationDeepLinks` option to `true` in the Radar `initialize` call.
```swift
radarInitializeOptions.autoHandleNotificationDeepLinks = true
Radar.initialize(publishableKey: "prj_test_pk_000", options: radarInitializeOptions )
```
### Manual iOS setup

If you want to set up deep linking manually, you can do so by adding the following line to your `UNUserNotificationCenterDelegate` implementation.
```swift
func userNotificationCenter(_ center: UNUserNotificationCenter, didReceive response: UNNotificationResponse) async {
  Radar.extractURLFromNotification(response.notification)
}
```

### Delegate to handle URL open

You can choose to handle the URL open directly by implementing `RadarURLDelegate` and setting the `urlDelegate` option in the Radar `initialize` call.

```swift
radarInitializeOptions.urlDelegate = self
Radar.initialize(publishableKey: "prj_test_pk_000", options: radarInitializeOptions )

extension AppDelegate: RadarURLDelegate {
  func didComplete(url: URL) {
    // handle url and direct user to the appropriate view
  }
}
```
### Default to handle system deep link

Alternately, not implementing the `RadarURLDelegate` will cause the SDK to default to calling `[application openURL:url options:@{} completionHandler:nil];` This will open the URL in the app if it is registered for the scheme, or open the URL in the browser if not.
Developers should handle this by handling the custom URL scheme or universal link in their app.

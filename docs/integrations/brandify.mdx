Radar can sync locations from [Brandify](http://www.brandify.com) as geofences in Radar, powered by [geofence sync](#geofence-sync).

The Brandify integration is available on the [Enterprise](https://radar.io/dashboard/pricing) plan.

## Configuration

Ask your Brandify account manager to enable a published CSV of your locations as Radar geofences. Then, on the Radar [Integrations page](/integrations) under *Geofence Sync*, set *Enabled* to *Yes*. Enter the published CSV URL. Note that you can set separate URLs for the *Test* and *Live* environments.

The geofence sync CSV format is the same as the [geofence import CSV format](/geofences#csv-import).

When you click *Save and Sync*, Radar will attempt a one-time sync and send an email on success or failure. Radar will then attempt syncs nightly.

With [Census](http://www.getcensus.com), Radar can sync locations stored in a data warehouse as geofences in Radar, powered by the [geofence upsert API](/api#upsert-a-geofence).

Census supports syncing data from all major data warehouses, including Amazon Athena and Redshift, Snowflake, Azure Synapse, and Google BigQuery.

## Configuration

First, in [Census](http://www.getcensus.com), add Radar as a service. Copy and paste your secret key from the Radar [dashboard](https://radar.com/dashboard). When naming the service, include a reference for the environment, `test` or `live`, that corresponds to the API key being used.

Second, create a data model and connect your data warehouse as a source.

Third, create a sync and map properties from the data model to [Radar geofence attributes](/geofences#create-geofences) like `description`, `tag`, `externalId`, `type`, and `radius`.

Finally, schedule your sync.

import AutocompleteInput from '../../src/components/AutocompleteInput.jsx'

Use Radar's autocomplete component to add address autocomplete to your websites and apps with just a few lines of code.

<AutocompleteInput />

You can also check out the [autocomplete explorer](https://radar.com/dashboard/maps/maps-explorer/autocomplete) in the dashboard, or check out a full-page [maps demo](https://radar.com/demo/maps) and [store locator demo](https://radar.com/demo/locator) with an autocomplete component.

## How it works

To use the autocomplete component, simply initialize the Radar SDK with your publishable key and specify the container to render the input into.

## Configuration

When creating the autocomplete component, you can provide options to customize the autocomplete behavior, as well as the size and style of the input.

Available options include:

<div className="full-width-table">

| Name  | Default | Possible values | Description           | SDK availability |
|-------|---------|-----------------|-----------------------|------------------|
| `container` | `autocomplete` | string \| HTMLElement | The container to render the map into. You can specify an `id` of an HTML element or a DOM element. If an `<input>` is provided as a container, the style of the input will not be modified. | Web |
| `width` | `400` | number \| string | The width of the input, a number (in pixels) or any valid CSS width. | Web |
| `maxHeight` | `null` | number \| string | The max height of the results list, a number (in pixels) or any valid CSS height. | Web |
| `near` | `null` | string \| Location | The location to search near, in the format `"latitude,longitude"` or `{ latitude, longitude }`. If not specified, the search will automatically be biased based on the client's [IP geolocation](/documentation/api#ip-geocode). | Web, React Native |
| `debounceMS` | `200` | number | The number of milliseconds to wait after typing is complete to refresh the results list. | Web, React Native |
| `threshold` | `3` | number | The minimum number of characters that need to be typed before fetching results. | Web, React Native |
| `limit` | `8` | number | The maximum number of results to show in the results list. | Web, React Native |
| `onSelection` | `null` | function `(address) => {}` | A function called when a result is selected from the results list. | Web, React Native |
| `onResults` | `null` | function `(addresses) => {}` | A function called when the results list is refreshed. | Web, React Native |
| `onError`  | `null` | function `(error) => {}` | A function called if any errors occur. | Web, React Native |
| `placeholder` | `Search address` | string | The placeholder string for the input. | Web, React Native |
| `responsive` | `true` | boolean | A boolean that indicates whether the input should expand to fill the parent container. If `responsive = true` and a `width` is specified, `width` will be treated as a `max-width`. | Web |
| `disabled` | `false` | boolean | A boolean that indicates whether the input should be disabled. | Web, React Native |
| `layers` | `null` | array | Optional layer filters. An array including one or more of `place`, `address`, `intersection`, `street`, `neighborhood`, `postalCode`, `locality`, `county`, `state`, `country`, `coarse`, and `fine`. See the [autocomplete API documentation](https://radar.com/documentation/api#autocomplete) for more info. | Web, React Native |
